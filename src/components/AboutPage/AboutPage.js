                <h2>History:</h2>
                <p>
                    "Too Much To Can" was born out of the common problem faced by home gardeners: an excess of homegrown goodies. We understand
                    the joy and satisfaction of growing your own food, but sometimes it can be challenging to keep up with the sheer quantity of produce.
                    That's where our app comes in, providing a solution for gardeners to connect with others in their community and share their bountiful harvests.
